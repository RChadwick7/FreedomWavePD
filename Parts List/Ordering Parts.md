Ordering parts:
This project was made with a bit of versatility and flexibility in mind. When you build this board properly, you will see a lot of missing components on the Printed Circuit Board. THIS IS NORMAL. Some parts are for future expansion, experimentation, or just in case there are issues with your particular parts. Follow the instructions and the video and you should end up with a working device.

Ordering a kit:
If you have never soldered or assembled an electronic kit before. I highly recommend you try a kit first. It will be good practice and give you confidence. There are a number of links to kits at Aliexpress.

Ordering the PCB:
The Printed Circuit Board, or PCB, will be ordered from a company that specializes in manufacturing PCB's. The process consists of sending then the FreedomWavePD Gerber files. While you can have any PCB company make your PCB, we have a link at JLCPCB.com and OSHPark.com to make ordering very easy. Simply click on the link, fill in your address and payment info and everything else is all set for you. JLCPCB Requires purchasing 5 boards. As odd as this sounds, purchasing 5 boards from JLCPCB is likely the cheapest way to get a single board. You can make more than one or share the extra boards with others.

Ordering the electronic components:
While there may be other sources, including Ebay, the two sources I decided on are Amazon and Aliexpress. Amazon will usually be much more expensive but you'll probably get the parts faster. Aliexpress has all the parts needed, at often a much lower price. Also, combining shipping or meeting certain minimums may result in shipping discounts. Unfortunately, a part with a similar description may not work with the FreedomWavePD. I have provided links to all parts. They have not all been tested but are believed to work. There are multiple links for each part in case one is not available or you want to order from Amazon instead of AliExpress. DO NOT ORDER FROM ALL LINKS or you will wind up with a lot of extra parts you don't need. For most parts, only one or two is needed. Sometimes, buying in higher quantities is actually cheaper than buying a single part. However, since you will need 8 driver modules it makes sense to shop around for the best price. The cheapest I have found was Aliexpress.

Ordering tools and consumables:
If you are already an electronics hobbyist, odds are VERY good you will not need any extra tools or supplies. Assuming you don't have the needed tools, links are provided for tools required to complete this project, as well as tools that likely will not be needed but could be helpful.

 Soldering Iron - I STRONGLY recommend a soldering iron with an adjustable temperature. Keeping the temperature right is very important to adequate soldering. Aliexpress has them as low as $5.00
 
 Soldering iron holder - You will be picking up and putting down the soldering iron a lot. It might be helpful to have a safe and convenient place to put or lay your soldering iron.
 
 Soldering iron tip cleaner - The soldering iron can get crud on the tip and will need to be cleaned from time to time. Often, you will have too much solder on the tip and need to remove solder. Some soldering irons come with a dry, flat sponge. This is a tip cleaner. Get it wet. Wipe the hot tip over the damp sponge to clean the tip. Do it fast, this isn't meant to burn the sponge. There are also other tip cleaners that work without water. These work as well. If you're trying to do this cheap and don't have a tip cleaner, a wet paper towel can work. Again, wipe fast, don't cook the paper towel.
 
 Solder - There are two main varieties of solder - Lead-free and lead. Lead solder, actually a 60-40 mixture of lead and tin, has been used for decades and works very well. If you don't eat it or fail to wash your hands after use, it's perfectly safe and strongly recommended. Lead-free solder melts at a higher temperature and usually doesn't flow well, making it's use more difficult. Do NOT use solder meant for plumbing! This solder has an acid core and will make a mess for this purpose. In general, higher quality (More expensive) solder flows better and is easier to work with.
 
 Solder wick or desoldering pump - These remove solder. Sometimes, you might find you have too much solder at a point. It might even bridge two or more points, which is very bad. In this case, a way to remove solder is helpful. A solder pump literally sucks up the molten solder. Solder wick or braid will more gently and slowly pull the solder out of a solder conection. 
 
 Flux - Flux is literally a magic powder or cream that makes soldering work really well. Without flux, the solder can get chunky and sticky, connecting across multiple pins and causing problems. Solder actually comes with flux embedded in it's core. This is usually enough flux. You can purchase extra flux separately, and it may be useful.
 
 Alcohol - Especially if you use extra flux, Alcohol is great for cleaning flux off a PCB. With the exception of the LCD and the speaker (Unless if the tab is still over the hole), all parts are safe to be sprayed, wiped, or even immersed in alcohol. Cleaning the board is probably not necessary but can make a neater finished product, as well as letting you examine connections for proper solder connections.
 
 Magnification - This can be as simple as reading glasses, or more complicated with a magnifier with a built-in light. If you're young with good eyesight, you might not need any magnification at all. It's still good to have.
 
 Files - A file is not required, but very useful for smoothing edges and rounding corners.
 
 Multimeter - While you won't need a multimeter to make a FreedomWavePD, you might need one if your project doesn't work after being finished. A multimeter can let you see what's going on in a way your eyes could never see. You can't tell if current is flowing or what the voltage is at a certain point just by looking. A multimeter lets you see what's going on. A Multimeter is also handy for verifying resistor values.
