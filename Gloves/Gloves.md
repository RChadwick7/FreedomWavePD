# Glove Options
There are basically two different types of actuators available. One simply vibrates. This is fairly easy to do, using either ERM or LRA vibrators. However, this is not what Dr. Peter Tass uses. The gloves used by Dr. Tass are tactors that physically push into the skin rapidly. This might seem the same but the theory is that the right nerves are stimulated by tactors. The gloves I created simply vibrate. Although I did observe positive results, my effort is now going into tactors. There are basically two categores of tactors. One is Magnetic, the other Piezo. While the FreedomWavePD should be able to drive the magnetic tactors, I will need to develop a daughterboard to mount on the FreedomWavePD to work with the Piezo tactors, if that need arises. Piezo tactors appear very expensive so most of the effort has cenered around magnetic tactors.

The first version of FreedomWavePD gloves are not described, but there are a lot of pictures, including pictures with measurements. These work and are easy to make, but are not ideal, as described above.

Another option is the V2 of FreedomWavePD gloves. I haven't made these yet. They are similar to V1 but have a hole the size of the LRA motor. The motor would be free to move within the hole. Either spandex or elastic goes on the outside covering the hole. The LRA motor is attached to the spandex/elastic. This isolates the vibration from the Velcro.

There are a number of gloves and actuators developed by varios people. Here are the ones I've found:

Dayton DAEX 13 mounting kit - This is a 3D printed housing for the Dayton DAEX-13-4SM actuator. You'll have to be creative attaching them to the fingertips. You also may need to put a 4 Ohm 3W resistor in series to let the FreedomWavePD controller run these safely. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6138476

Godef v2.3 Latest, has stylus on tips. Not released yet.

Godef v2.2 - 3D printed clip-on housing for the Tectonic TEAX09C005-8 actuator, which unfortunately is currently sold out from most resellers. This should work directly with the FreedomWavePD Control unit, configured to use LRA. Located here: https://bb.f2heal.com/viewtopic.php?t=47 and here: https://github.com/F2HEAL/VHP-Vibro-Glove2/

Godef 2.0 - These use the same Tectonic TEAX09C005-8 actuator but do not have the clip to hold them on to the fingertip. Located here: https://bb.f2heal.com/viewtopic.php?t=9
