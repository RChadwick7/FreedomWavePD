Dayton Exciter

From WinnieThePoo:
Ok. The product code is DAEX-13-4SM. They are 8 euros from sound imports in Italy, which is where I buy them. I'm sure you'll find them in the USA easily enough.

They are secured with M3 6mm steel bolts which self-tap into the soft plastic PLA.  They are not symmetrical.  Once you use the guide rod to fix the plastic disc to the adhesive on the exciter, then they have to fit in the housing that way round.  If you put them in reversed, the contact pin will be a bit off-centre.
