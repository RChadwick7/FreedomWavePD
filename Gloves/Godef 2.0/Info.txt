3D design housing and contactor pin for TECTONIC TEAX09C005-8 Audio Exciters | design pgodefroy

We have chosen a tight press fit of the TEAX9, instead of glueing them against a fix stop. This should allow us to play with the length of how much the contactor protrudes from the housing and also to compensate for tolerances.

The dimension of the housing are 31x18x17 mm (lxwxh).
The diameter of the contactor pin is 4 mm.
