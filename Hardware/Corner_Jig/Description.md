This tool is not required, but handy if you have a 3D printer.

Assuming you are using a plastic sheet exactly 4 inches by 6 inches. this will locate the mounting holes. Simply slip on each corner snugly and drill in the hole. 

This can also be used as a template to file a nice rounded corner.

Once drilling the holes, using a 3mm drill, the resulting 4x6 plastic sheet can be used as either a top or bottom covering for the printed circuit board.

Plexiglas is not recommended as it cracks very easily.
