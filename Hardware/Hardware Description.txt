Hardware:

The microcontroller for this is an Arduino Nano v3.0. The output pins go to a TCA9548A, which allows programming the DRV2605L driver IC's individually (Since the driver chips all have the same address). The I2C bus also goes to the LCD. 8 or 10 lines from PortD go to easc FRV2605L to allow triggering without the overhead of using I2C. The PCB also has room for LED's and a connector so theser outputs can be observed. The outputs of the DRV2605L's go directly to the ERM/LRA vibrators. The DRV2605L is designed for an 8 Ohm load. If you use a 4 Ohm actuator, it is required to place a 4 Ohm resistor in series with the actuator.
