Hardware:

Until I create a schematic, this description should help people create their own hardware. The heart of the hardware is an Arduino Nano, which uses an Atmel ATMega328. The I2C bus is configured as PortC.5 as SCL and PortC.4 as SDA. PinC.0 and PinC.1 is used for the encoder and PinC.2 is the encoder pushbutton. The LCD is a typical 16x2 parralel LCD with an add-on board that interfaces to I2C. The 8 output pins are PortD0-PortD7. The output pins go to the driver IC's, the DRv2605a. The I2C bus also hoes to a TCA9548A, which allows to program all 8 driver chips individually (Since the driver chips all have the same address). The I2C outputs go directly to easy DRV2605a IC. The outputs go directly to the ERM/LRA vibrators. Although not recommended, my test version is powered through the Arduino Nano through the USB port.
